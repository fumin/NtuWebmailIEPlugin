Remember to run visual Studio tools with "Administrator privilege!!"

>cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\vc

>midl.exe /out D:\Desktop\midl\midl D:\Desktop\midl\midl\testmidl.idl


The result is the creation of 5 new files (for which only three will need to be included in our example):
  dlldata.c
  testmidl.h  // extern "C" CLID_ISUM
  testmidl.tlb  //our type library
  testmidl_i.c
  testmidl_p.c  //defines the global variable CLID_ISUM
